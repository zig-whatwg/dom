# Session Summary - October 17, 2025

## Overview

Completed setup and documentation for the cross-browser benchmark suite, ensuring proper git hygiene and clear user workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Git Configuration (`5d1129d`)

**Fixed**: node_modules and generated files were being tracked by git

**Changes**:
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
  - `benchmarks/js/node_modules/`
  - `benchmarks/js/package-lock.json`
  - `benchmarks/js/benchmark.html` (generated file)
- Unstaged 300+ node_modules files that were accidentally added
- Ensured only intentional artifacts are tracked

### 2. Benchmark Infrastructure (`5d1129d`)

**Problem**: `zig build benchmark-all` would fail if Playwright wasn't installed, but auto-installing on every run is too slow (~500MB download)

**Solution**:
- Created `benchmarks/setup.sh` - One-time installation script
  - Checks for Node.js installation
  - Runs `npm install` in `benchmarks/js/`
  - Installs Playwright browsers
  - Clear success messaging
- Updated `benchmarks/run-all.sh` to check for setup
  - Exits with helpful error if node_modules missing
  - Provides exact commands to run for setup
- Modified to be executable (`chmod +x`)

**Workflow**:
```bash
# One-time setup (first time only)
./benchmarks/setup.sh

# Run benchmarks (any time)
zig build benchmark-all -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### 3. Documentation Updates (`5d1129d` + `64c4110`)

**README.md**:
- Added **Performance** section between Testing and Documentation
- Documented benchmark quick start
- Listed all query optimizations with O(1) timings:
  - `getElementById`: ~5ns
  - `querySelector("#id")`: ~15ns
  - `querySelector("tag")`: ~15ns  
  - `querySelector(".class")`: ~15ns
  - `getElementsByTagName`: ~7Âµs for 500 elements
  - `getElementsByClassName`: ~7Âµs for 500 elements
- Added cross-browser benchmark suite to Features list
- Added benchmarks/README.md to documentation list

**benchmarks/README.md**:
- Emphasized `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` requirement (added warning banner)
- Updated "Run Benchmarks" section to always show the flag
- Clear separation between one-time setup and regular usage

**CHANGELOG.md**:
- Added comprehensive entry for Cross-Browser Benchmark Suite
- Listed all infrastructure components:
  - Playwright-based runner (3 browsers)
  - 24 synchronized benchmarks
  - Interactive HTML visualization
  - Automated pipeline
  - Setup script
  - Documentation
  - Benchmark parity skill

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
.gitignore                      # Added node_modules exclusions
benchmarks/setup.sh             # NEW: One-time setup script
benchmarks/run-all.sh           # Check for setup before running
benchmarks/README.md            # Emphasized ReleaseFast requirement
benchmark_results/              # Updated with latest run
README.md                       # Added Performance section
CHANGELOG.md                    # Documented benchmark suite
```

### Git Commits
1. `5d1129d` - chore: improve benchmark setup and documentation
2. `64c4110` - docs: add cross-browser benchmark suite to README and CHANGELOG

## Key Decisions

### 1. Manual Setup Required
**Decision**: Don't auto-install Playwright on every benchmark run

**Rationale**:
- Browser installation is ~500MB and slow
- Only needed once per system
- Clear error messages guide users
- Standard npm workflow (like other projects)

### 2. Git Exclusions
**Decision**: Never commit node_modules or generated files

**Rationale**:
- node_modules is 300+ files, changes frequently
- Users should run `npm install` to get exact versions
- Generated files (benchmark.html, package-lock.json) are recreated
- Standard JavaScript project convention

### 3. Always Emphasize ReleaseFast
**Decision**: Document `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` prominently

**Rationale**:
- Debug builds are 10-100x slower
- Users might not realize the flag is required
- Added warning banner to README
- Updated all example commands

## Testing Performed

1. âœ… Verified .gitignore excludes node_modules
2. âœ… Confirmed node_modules successfully unstaged
3. âœ… Tested that setup.sh script is executable
4. âœ… Verified run-all.sh continues to work with existing setup
5. âœ… Checked git status shows clean working tree

## Current Status

### âœ… Complete
- Git hygiene (no tracked node_modules)
- Setup infrastructure (one-time script)
- Documentation (README, CHANGELOG, benchmarks/README)
- Clear user workflow
- All commits pushed to main

### ðŸ“Š Benchmark Results

Latest timings (Phase 4, ReleaseFast):
```
- getElementById:                5ns  (O(1))
- querySelector("#id"):         15ns  (O(1))
- querySelector("tag"):         15ns  (O(1))
- querySelector(".class"):      15ns  (O(1))
- getElementsByTagName (500):    7Âµs  (O(k))
- getElementsByClassName (500):  7Âµs  (O(k))
```

All three major query types (ID, tag, class) achieve identical O(1) performance!

## User Workflow

### New User
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo>

# One-time setup
./benchmarks/setup.sh

# Run benchmarks
zig build benchmark-all -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# View results
open benchmark_results/benchmark_report.html
```

### Existing User
```bash
# Already set up, just run benchmarks
zig build benchmark-all -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Files for Next Session

### Created/Modified
- `.gitignore` - Benchmark exclusions
- `benchmarks/setup.sh` - NEW setup script
- `benchmarks/run-all.sh` - Setup verification
- `benchmarks/README.md` - ReleaseFast emphasis
- `README.md` - Performance section
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Benchmark suite entry

### Not Committed (Intentionally)
- `benchmarks/js/node_modules/` - User installs via setup.sh
- `benchmarks/js/package-lock.json` - Generated by npm
- `benchmark_results/*.json` (timestamped) - Old runs
- Latest benchmark results - Just timing variations

## Notes for Maintainers

1. **Benchmark Parity**: When adding new benchmarks, update both Zig and JavaScript (see `skills/benchmark_parity/SKILL.md`)

2. **Setup Script**: If Playwright version changes, update `benchmarks/js/package.json` and users re-run `./benchmarks/setup.sh`

3. **Documentation**: Performance numbers in README should be updated when major optimizations are added

4. **CI/CD**: Consider adding benchmark runner to CI (see benchmarks/README.md for GitHub Actions example)

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Zero files in node_modules tracked by git
- âœ… Clear one-time setup process
- âœ… `zig build benchmark-all` works reliably
- âœ… Documentation emphasizes ReleaseFast
- âœ… All commits follow conventional commit format
- âœ… CHANGELOG.md up to date
- âœ… README.md shows Performance section

## What's Next

Ready for users to:
1. Run `./benchmarks/setup.sh` (first time)
2. Run `zig build benchmark-all -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
3. Open beautiful HTML visualization
4. Compare Zig performance with Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

The benchmark infrastructure is production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
