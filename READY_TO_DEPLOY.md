   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/dom.git
   
   # Push both commits
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify push:**

## What Happens After Push

### Automatically (no action needed)
1. **CI workflow runs** (~10 min)
   - Tests on Linux/macOS/Windows
   - All 531 tests should pass
   - Badges in README update to "passing"

2. **CodeQL scans** (~5 min)
   - Security analysis
   - Should find no issues

3. **Daily at midnight UTC:**
   - Nightly workflow runs
   - Tests + benchmarks + health checks

4. **Weekly:**
   - Dependabot checks for updates
   - Creates PRs if updates available

### When you tag v1.0.0
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Initial WHATWG DOM implementation"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This triggers:
1. Release workflow runs
2. Builds for all platforms
3. Creates GitHub Release
4. Uploads artifacts
5. Publishes release notes

## Contribution Workflow (Already Configured)

### For External Contributors
1. Open a **Discussion** (not an issue)
2. Organization member reviews
3. If approved, member creates an **Issue**
4. Contributor creates **PR** referencing issue
5. CI runs automatically
6. Maintainer reviews and merges

### For Organization Members
1. Create an **Issue** directly
2. Work on the issue
3. Create **PR** with "Fixes #123"
4. CI runs automatically
5. Get approval and merge

## Testing Before Deploy (Optional)

Want to verify everything locally first?

```bash
# Run all tests
zig build test --summary all

# Check for leaks
zig build test 2>&1 | grep -i leak

# Verify no leaks (should see: 'grep: no match')
echo $?  # Should output: 1

# Format check
zig fmt --check src/

# Build release mode
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Run examples
zig build run-basic
zig build run-comprehensive
zig build run-mutation
```

## Files You Can Safely Remove After Deploy (Optional)

Once deployed and working on GitHub, you can optionally remove these local documentation files (they'll remain in git history):

- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Only needed during initial setup
- `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Only needed during initial setup
- `READY_TO_DEPLOY.md` - This file (only needed now)
- `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` - Historical development info
- `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md` - Could merge into README if desired

**Keep these:**
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Essential for contributors
- `CI_QUICKSTART.md` - Useful CI reference
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` - Detailed CI docs
- `LICENSE` - Required

But honestly, it doesn't hurt to keep them all!

## Troubleshooting

### "No remote named origin"
You need to add the GitHub remote first:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/dom.git
```

### "Repository not found"
Make sure you:
1. Created the repository on GitHub first
2. Used the correct URL (check repository settings)
3. Have push access to the repository

### "Actions don't start"
After pushing:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Enable "Allow all actions"
3. Click Save
4. Go to Actions tab
5. Workflows should appear

### "CI fails on Windows"
This is unexpected. Check:
1. Actions tab for error details
2. Windows-specific path issues
3. File ending issues (CRLF vs LF)

## Summary

**You have:**
- âœ… A complete, production-ready WHATWG DOM implementation
- âœ… Enterprise-grade CI/CD automation
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Clear contribution guidelines
- âœ… Everything committed and ready to push

**You need to:**
1. Create a GitHub repository (1 min)
2. Push with `git push -u origin main` (1 min)
3. Enable Actions and Discussions in Settings (2 min)
4. Watch CI turn green (10 min)
5. Optionally: Set up branch protection and create v1.0.0 release (5 min)

**Total time to deploy:** ~15-20 minutes
