## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks) → 72 tests (13%)
**Goal**: Add WPT tests for already-implemented features
- CharacterData (insertData, replaceData)
- Range API (5 representative tests)
- TreeWalker & NodeIterator (10 tests)
- DOMTokenList (4 tests)
- HTMLCollection (5 tests)
- AbortSignal (3 tests)

**Outcome**: Jump from 42 to 72 tests instantly

### Phase 2: Critical Core (12 weeks) → 167 tests (30%)
**Goal**: User-facing features expected in any DOM library
- ParentNode mixin (append, prepend, replaceChildren)
- ChildNode mixin (after, before, replaceWith)
- Element operations (closest, matches, getElementsBy*)
- Event system foundation (Event constructor, dispatch, propagation)
- Document operations (adoptNode, importNode)

**Milestone**: v1.0 - Production-ready core DOM

### Phase 3: High Priority (10 weeks) → 306 tests (56%)
**Goal**: Full WHATWG spec compliance
- Selectors (querySelector edge cases, :scope, namespaces)
- Advanced node operations (Text.splitText, DocumentFragment.getElementById)
- Collections & lists (iteration, live updates, stringifiers)
- Namespaces (createElementNS, setAttributeNS)
- Event advanced features (listener options, composed path)
- Range mutations (auto-adjust boundaries)

**Milestone**: v1.5 - Full DOM Level 4 compliance

### Phase 4: Medium Priority (12 weeks) → 454 tests (83%)
**Goal**: Advanced features for modern web apps
- Shadow DOM core (attachShadow, slots, event retargeting)
- Custom Elements core (define, lifecycle callbacks, upgrading)
- Advanced events (shadow DOM paths, cross-realm)

**Milestone**: v2.0 - Modern Web Components support

### Phase 5: Low Priority (Future) → 550 tests (100%)
**Goal**: Polish and edge cases
- Cross-realm edge cases
- Rare namespace scenarios
- Historical/legacy API tests
- Performance edge cases

**Milestone**: v2.5+ - Complete spec coverage

## 🔍 Deep Dive: What's Most Important

### The #1 Gap: Event System (120 tests, 0% coverage)
**Impact**: HIGH - Events are fundamental to DOM
**Current State**: EventTarget partially implemented, but:
- ❌ No Event constructor
- ❌ No CustomEvent constructor
- ❌ No event dispatch
- ❌ No propagation (capture/bubble)
- ❌ No stopPropagation/preventDefault

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Events in Phase 2 (4-5 weeks investment)

### The Biggest Surprise: Already Implemented!
You have comprehensive implementations with **NO WPT tests**:
- **Range API**: 54 unit tests covering 29/40 scenarios
- **TreeWalker/NodeIterator**: Fully working implementations
- **MutationObserver**: 24 unit tests (~92% WPT coverage)
- **AbortSignal**: 24 comprehensive unit tests
- **DOMTokenList**: 42 assertions in unit tests

**Recommendation**: Convert these to WPT tests FIRST (Phase 1 Quick Wins)

### The Most Valuable Next Step: Modern DOM Manipulation
**ParentNode & ChildNode mixins** (18 tests, 2-3 weeks):
- `append()`, `prepend()`, `replaceChildren()`
- `after()`, `before()`, `replaceWith()`

**Why?**: These are the #1 APIs developers expect. They make DOM manipulation ergonomic and match JavaScript best practices.

## 🎓 Key Insights

### What This Analysis Reveals

1. **You're doing better than the numbers suggest**
   - 7.6% WPT coverage, but ~30% implementation coverage
   - Many features fully implemented, just need WPT tests converted
   - Unit test coverage is strong for what's implemented

2. **Events are the critical path**
   - 120 tests (22% of total) with 0% coverage
   - Most other features depend on events
   - Should be prioritized in Phase 2

3. **Quick wins are real**
   - 30 tests can be added in 1-2 weeks
   - Zero new implementation needed
   - Validates existing implementations against spec

4. **Shadow DOM & Custom Elements are large but optional**
   - 174 tests combined (32% of total)
   - Can defer to v2.0
   - Core DOM is more important for v1.0

5. **Selectors are table stakes**
   - querySelector/querySelectorAll have partial coverage
   - closest() and matches() are missing but critical
   - Should be in Phase 2 (v1.0)

### Recommendations

**For v1.0 (4-5 months)**:
- Focus on Core DOM (Phases 1-2)
- Target 175+ tests (32% coverage)
- Prioritize user-facing APIs
- Event system is non-negotiable

**For v2.0 (10-12 months)**:
- Add Shadow DOM & Custom Elements (Phases 3-4)
- Target 330+ tests (60% coverage)
- Enable modern web component development

**For Long Term**:
- Achieve 100% WPT coverage
- Maintain parity with browser implementations
- Contribute findings back to WPT
