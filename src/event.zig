/// Represents the different phases of event propagation.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// During event dispatch, an event progresses through different phases as it
/// travels through the DOM tree. Understanding these phases is crucial for
/// proper event handling and event delegation patterns.
///
/// The event flow has three phases:
/// 1. **Capture Phase**: Event travels from root to target
/// 2. **Target Phase**: Event reaches its target
/// 3. **Bubble Phase**: Event travels from target back to root (if bubbles is true)
///
/// ## Phases
///
/// - `none` (0): The event is not currently being dispatched. This is the initial
///   and final state of an event.
///
/// - `capturing_phase` (1): The event is in the capture phase, traveling from the
///   root to the target. Event listeners registered with `capture: true` are
///   invoked during this phase.
///
/// - `at_target` (2): The event has reached its target. Both capture and bubble
///   phase listeners on the target are invoked during this phase.
///
/// - `bubbling_phase` (3): The event is in the bubble phase, traveling from the
///   target back to the root. Event listeners registered with `capture: false`
///   are invoked during this phase. This phase only occurs if the event's
///   `bubbles` property is true.
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```zig
/// const handleEvent = struct {
///     fn callback(event: *Event) void {
///         switch (event.event_phase) {
///             .none => std.debug.print("Event not dispatching\n", .{}),
///             .capturing_phase => std.debug.print("Capture phase\n", .{}),
///             .at_target => std.debug.print("At target\n", .{}),
///             .bubbling_phase => std.debug.print("Bubble phase\n", .{}),
///         }
///     }
/// }.callback;
/// ```
///
/// ## Specification Compliance
///
/// The numeric values match the DOM specification constants:
/// - NONE = 0
/// - CAPTURING_PHASE = 1
/// - AT_TARGET = 2
/// - BUBBLING_PHASE = 3

///
/// ## Overview
///
/// An Event object is created whenever something happens that scripts might want
/// to know about - a user clicking on something, a document loading, an animation
/// finishing, and so on. The Event interface is the base for all events in the DOM.
///
/// Events are dispatched to EventTarget objects, which can register event listeners
/// to be notified when events of a particular type occur. The event object contains
/// information about what happened and provides methods to control event propagation.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// ### Event Type
/// Each event has a type (e.g., "click", "load", "error") that identifies what
/// kind of event it is. Event types are case-sensitive strings.
///
/// ### Event Target
/// The target is the object to which the event was originally dispatched. It
/// remains constant throughout event propagation.
///
/// ### Current Target
/// During event dispatch, the currentTarget changes to indicate which object's
/// event listeners are currently being invoked.
///
/// ### Event Propagation
/// Events can propagate through a tree structure in three phases:
/// 1. Capture (root to target)
/// 2. Target (at the target)
/// 3. Bubble (target to root, if bubbles is true)
///
/// ### Cancelation
/// If an event is cancelable, calling preventDefault() will signal that the
/// event's default action should not be taken.
///
/// ### Composition
/// Events with composed=true can cross shadow DOM boundaries; those with
/// composed=false are confined to their shadow tree.
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```zig
/// const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;
///
/// // Create a custom event
/// const event = try Event.init(allocator, "customEvent", .{
///     .bubbles = true,      // Event will bubble
///     .cancelable = true,   // Can be cancelled
///     .composed = false,    // Won't cross shadow boundaries
/// });
/// defer event.deinit();
///
/// // Check event properties
/// std.debug.print("Type: {s}\n", .{event.type_name});
/// std.debug.print("Bubbles: {}\n", .{event.bubbles});
/// std.debug.print("Trusted: {}\n", .{event.is_trusted});
///
/// // Control event propagation
/// event.stopPropagation();          // Stop propagation
/// event.preventDefault();            // Cancel default action
///
/// // Check state
/// if (event.default_prevented) {
///     std.debug.print("Default action was prevented\n", .{});
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Specification Compliance
///
/// This implementation follows the WHATWG DOM Standard (ยง2.2 Interface Event):
/// - Event creation with constructor (new Event)
/// - Event initialization flags (bubbles, cancelable, composed)
/// - Event phase tracking (none, capturing, at_target, bubbling)
/// - Event propagation control (stopPropagation, stopImmediatePropagation)
/// - Default action prevention (preventDefault, defaultPrevented)
/// - Trust indication (isTrusted)
/// - Timestamp tracking (timeStamp)
/// - Composed path support (composedPath)
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// ### Memory Management
/// Events are allocated on the heap and must be freed with deinit().
/// The event type string is duplicated and managed internally.
///
/// ### Trust Flag
/// The isTrusted flag is set to false for synthetic events created via the
/// constructor. Only events created by the user agent are trusted.
///
/// ### Timestamp
/// The timestamp is set to the current time in milliseconds when the event
/// is created, using std.time.milliTimestamp().
///
/// ### Targets
/// Both target and currentTarget are stored as opaque pointers to allow
/// flexibility in what can be an event target.

    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// A pointer to the newly created Event object. The caller is responsible

    ///
    /// ## Memory Management
    ///
    /// This method allocates memory for:
    /// 1. The Event struct itself
    /// 2. A copy of the type_name string
    ///
    /// Both allocations are freed by deinit(). If allocation fails, an error
    /// is returned and no memory is leaked.
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if:

    ///
    /// ## Behavior
    ///
    /// ### Cancelable Events
    /// If the event's `cancelable` property is true:
    /// - Sets `default_prevented` to true

    ///
    /// ### Non-Cancelable Events
    /// If the event's `cancelable` property is false:
    /// - The call has no effect
    /// - `default_prevented` remains false
    /// - No error or warning is generated
    ///
    /// ## When to Use
    ///
    /// Common use cases:
    /// - Prevent form submission (`submit` event)
    /// - Prevent link navigation (`click` event on links)
    /// - Prevent context menu (`contextmenu` event)
    /// - Prevent text selection (`selectstart` event)
    /// - Prevent drag operations (`dragstart` event)
    ///
    /// ## Checking Prevention
    ///
    /// After dispatching, check `defaultPrevented` or the return value of
    /// `dispatchEvent()`:
    /// - `dispatchEvent()` returns false if preventDefault was called
    /// - `event.default_prevented` is true if preventDefault was called
    ///
    /// ## Examples
    ///
    /// ### Preventing Form Submission
    /// ```zig
    /// const handleSubmit = struct {

    ///         // Validate form...
    ///         if (!formIsValid()) {

    ///
    /// ### Effect on Propagation
    /// - Sets the `propagation_stopped` flag to true

    ///
    /// ### Phase-Specific Behavior
    ///
    /// **Capture Phase**:
    /// - Remaining capture phase targets are skipped
    /// - Target phase listeners ARE invoked
    /// - Bubble phase is skipped
    ///
    /// **Target Phase**:
    /// - All listeners on the target ARE invoked
    /// - Bubble phase is skipped
    ///
    /// **Bubble Phase**:
    /// - Remaining bubble phase targets are skipped
    ///
    /// ## Difference from stopImmediatePropagation
    ///
    /// - `stopPropagation()`: Other listeners on current target still execute
    /// - `stopImmediatePropagation()`: No more listeners execute at all
    ///
    /// ## When to Use
    ///
    /// Use when you want to:
    /// - Handle an event at a specific level without propagating further
    /// - Prevent parent handlers from being called
    /// - Implement event delegation with specific stopping points
    /// - Optimize performance by limiting propagation

    ///         event.stopPropagation();
    ///     }
    /// }.callback;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Specification Compliance
    ///
    /// Per DOM Standard ยง2.2:
    /// "The stopPropagation() method steps are to set this's stop propagation flag."
    ///
    /// The dispatch algorithm checks this flag at each step and skips further
    /// propagation when it is set.
    ///
    /// ## Reference
    ///
    /// * WHATWG DOM Standard: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-stoppropagation
    /// * MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation
    pub fn stopPropagation(self: *Self) void {
        self.propagation_stopped = true;
    }

    /// Prevents all further listener invocation for this event.
    ///
    /// When called during event dispatch, this method immediately stops all event
    /// processing. No other listeners will be called, not even on the current target.
    /// This is the most aggressive way to stop event processing.
    ///
    /// ## Behavior
    ///
    /// ### Immediate Effect
    /// - Sets both `propagation_stopped` and `immediate_propagation_stopped` flags
    /// - Stops the current listener loop immediately
    /// - No subsequent listeners are invoked, even on the current target
    /// - No further propagation occurs
    ///
    /// ### Listener Execution Order
    ///
    /// If multiple listeners are registered on the same target:
    /// ```
    /// Listener 1 executes
    /// Listener 2 executes and calls stopImmediatePropagation()
    /// Listener 3 DOES NOT execute  โ stopped
    /// Listener 4 DOES NOT execute  โ stopped
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Difference from stopPropagation
    ///
    /// | Method | Current Target Listeners | Propagation |
    /// |--------|-------------------------|-------------|
    /// | stopPropagation() | All execute | Stopped |
    /// | stopImmediatePropagation() | Remaining skipped | Stopped |
    ///
    /// ## When to Use
    ///
    /// Use when you need to:
    /// - Completely stop all event processing
    /// - Ensure no other code can respond to the event
    /// - Handle critical events that should not be processed further
    /// - Prevent conflicts between multiple handlers
    ///
    /// ## Use Cases
    ///
    /// - **Critical Error Handling**: Stop all processing when an error occurs
    /// - **Security**: Prevent potentially malicious handlers from executing
    /// - **Performance**: Skip unnecessary listeners when outcome is determined
    /// - **Exclusive Handling**: Ensure only one handler processes the event
    ///
    /// ## Examples
    ///
    /// ### Stop All Listeners
    /// ```zig
    /// target.addEventListener("click", listener1, .{});
    /// target.addEventListener("click", listener2, .{});
    /// target.addEventListener("click", listener3, .{});
    ///
    /// const listener1 = struct {

    ///
    /// const listener2 = struct {
    ///     fn callback(event: *Event) void {
    ///         std.debug.print("Listener 2 executes\n", .{});
    ///         event.stopImmediatePropagation(); // Stop here
    ///     }
    /// }.callback;
    ///
    /// const listener3 = struct {
    ///     fn callback(event: *Event) void {
    ///         // This will NOT execute
    ///         std.debug.print("Listener 3 would execute\n", .{});
    ///     }
    /// }.callback;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Critical Error Handler
    /// ```zig
    /// const handleCriticalError = struct {
    ///     fn callback(event: *Event) void {
    ///         std.debug.print("Critical error detected!\n", .{});
    ///         event.stopImmediatePropagation();
    ///         // No other handlers should process this
    ///     }
    /// }.callback;
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Exclusive Processing
    /// ```zig
    /// const handleExclusive = struct {
    ///     fn callback(event: *Event) void {
    ///         if (shouldHandleExclusively()) {
    ///             // Process the event
    ///             processEvent(event);
    ///             // Prevent any other handlers

    /// Returns the event's path, which is an array of objects on which listeners

    ///
    /// The composed path represents the sequence of EventTarget objects that will
    /// (or did) receive the event during dispatch. The path depends on the event's
    /// `composed` flag and shadow DOM boundaries.
    ///
    /// ## Parameters
    ///
    /// - `allocator`: The memory allocator to use for the returned path array.
    ///   The caller is responsible for freeing the returned slice.
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// An array of opaque pointers representing the event's propagation path.
    /// The caller must free this array when done:
    ///
    /// ```zig
    /// const path = try event.composedPath(allocator);
    /// defer allocator.free(path);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Path Composition
    ///
    /// ### Without Shadow DOM
    /// The path is simply the chain from target to root:
    /// ```
    /// [root, parent, child, target]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### With Shadow DOM (composed: false)
    /// The path stops at shadow boundaries:
    /// ```
    /// [shadow-root, shadow-child, target]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### With Shadow DOM (composed: true)
    /// The path crosses shadow boundaries:
    /// ```
    /// [document, host, shadow-root, shadow-child, target]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Note
    ///
    /// The current implementation returns an empty path as a stub. A complete
    /// implementation would:
    /// 1. Start at the event's target
    /// 2. Traverse up through parent nodes
    /// 3. Handle shadow DOM boundaries based on `composed` flag
    /// 4. Return the path in order from root to target
    ///
    /// This requires the Node tree structure (ยง4.2) to be implemented.
    ///
    /// ## Usage Examples
    ///
    /// ### Basic Usage
    /// ```zig
    /// const event = try Event.init(allocator, "click", .{
    ///     .composed = true,
    /// });
    /// defer event.deinit();
    ///
    /// const path = try event.composedPath(allocator);
    /// defer allocator.free(path);
    ///
    /// for (path) |target| {
    ///     std.debug.print("Target: {*}\n", .{target});
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Checking Path Length
    /// ```zig
    /// const path = try event.composedPath(allocator);
    /// defer allocator.free(path);
    ///
    /// std.debug.print("Event will visit {} targets\n", .{path.len});
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Specification Compliance
    ///
    /// Per DOM Standard ยง2.2, composedPath() returns the event's path with
    /// shadow tree nodes filtered based on the shadow root's mode and the
    /// current target.
    ///
    /// The algorithm is defined in detail in ยง2.2 but requires:
    /// - Node tree structure
    /// - Shadow DOM support
    /// - Path tracking during dispatch
    ///
    /// ## Future Implementation
    ///
    /// When Node tree is implemented, this method should:
    /// 1. Build path from target to root
    /// 2. Filter shadow tree nodes appropriately
    /// 3. Return ordered array of targets
    ///
    /// ## Reference
