## 🎉 The Biggest Surprise: Quick Wins!

### You Have Implementations With NO WPT Tests!

The analysis revealed that many features are **fully implemented** with comprehensive unit tests, but have **zero WPT tests**:

1. **Range API**: 54 unit tests covering 29/40 WPT scenarios
2. **TreeWalker/NodeIterator**: Fully working implementations
3. **MutationObserver**: 24 unit tests (~92% WPT coverage)
4. **AbortSignal**: 24 comprehensive unit tests
5. **DOMTokenList**: 42 assertions in unit tests
6. **HTMLCollection**: Live collection implementation
7. **CharacterData**: insertData/replaceData implemented

### The Quick Win Opportunity

**Add 30 WPT tests in 1-2 weeks**:
- Zero new implementation needed
- Just convert WPT HTML tests to Zig
- Validates existing implementations against spec
- Coverage jumps from 42 → 72 tests (71% increase!)

**Impact**: Instant validation of existing work + massive coverage boost

## 🚨 The Biggest Gaps

### #1: Event System (120 tests, 0% coverage)

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Event constructor
- ❌ CustomEvent constructor
- ❌ Event dispatch
- ❌ Propagation (capture/bubble)
- ❌ stopPropagation/preventDefault
- ❌ Event properties (defaultPrevented, isTrusted, timeStamp)

**Why Critical**: Events are fundamental to DOM. Almost every interactive feature depends on them.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize in Phase 2 (4-5 weeks)

### #2: Modern DOM Manipulation (18 tests)

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ ParentNode mixin: append(), prepend(), replaceChildren()
- ❌ ChildNode mixin: after(), before(), replaceWith()

**Why Critical**: These are the #1 APIs developers expect. They make DOM manipulation ergonomic.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize in Phase 2 (2-3 weeks)

### #3: Selectors (25 tests, partial coverage)

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Element.closest() - Find ancestor matching selector
- ❌ Element.matches() - Test if element matches selector
- ❌ querySelector edge cases (:scope, namespaces, escapes)

**Why Critical**: Selectors are table stakes for any DOM library.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize in Phase 2 (2-3 weeks)

### #4: Cross-Document Operations (20 tests)

**What's Missing**:
- ❌ Document.adoptNode() - Adopt node from another document
- ❌ Document.importNode() - Import node from another document

**Why Critical**: Required for multi-document scenarios and iframes.

**Recommendation**: Include in Phase 2 (2-3 weeks)

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. You're Better Than The Numbers Suggest
- 7.6% WPT coverage BUT ~30% implementation coverage
- Many features fully implemented, just need WPT validation
- Unit test coverage is strong for what exists

### 2. Events Are The Critical Path
- 120 tests (22% of total) with 0% coverage
- Most other features depend on events
- Must be prioritized in Phase 2

### 3. Quick Wins Are Real
- 30 tests can be added in 1-2 weeks
- Zero new implementation needed
- Validates existing implementations

### 4. Shadow DOM & Custom Elements Are Optional for v1.0
- 174 tests combined (32% of total)
- Can defer to v2.0
- Core DOM is more important initially

### 5. Selectors Are Table Stakes
- querySelector/querySelectorAll partially implemented
- closest() and matches() missing but critical
- Should be in Phase 2 (v1.0)
