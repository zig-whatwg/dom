# Session Update: Phase 1 Event System Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Session Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**

---

## What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Event System (Complete ✅)

Implemented C-ABI bindings for Event, CustomEvent, and EventTarget interfaces.

**Files Created**:
1. ✅ `js-bindings/event.zig` (17 functions)
   - Properties: type, eventPhase, bubbles, cancelable, defaultPrevented, composed, isTrusted, timeStamp
   - Constants: NONE, CAPTURING_PHASE, AT_TARGET, BUBBLING_PHASE
   - Methods: stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation(), preventDefault()
   - Memory: addref(), release()

2. ✅ `js-bindings/customevent.zig` (3 functions)
   - Property: detail (void* pointer for custom data)
   - Memory: addref(), release()

3. ✅ `js-bindings/test_events.c` (4 tests, all passing)
   - Event constants validation
   - EventTarget.dispatchEvent signature check
   - Memory management functions validation
   - CustomEvent functions validation

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `js-bindings/dom_types.zig` - Added `DOMEvent`, `DOMCustomEvent` opaque types
- ✅ `js-bindings/eventtarget.zig` - Updated with dispatchEvent implementation
- ✅ `js-bindings/root.zig` - Added event, customevent modules

## Progress Statistics

### Overall Progress
- **Total Functions**: 199 (up from 179)
- **Library Size**: 2.9 MB (up from 2.8 MB)

- **Phases Complete**: 4 total
  - Phase 2: Collections ✅
  - Phase 3: Text Nodes ✅
  - Phase 4: Attributes ✅
  - Phase 1: Event System ✅

### This Session
- **New Functions**: 20
  - Event: 17 functions
  - CustomEvent: 3 functions
- **New Tests**: 4 (all passing)
- **Time**: ~45 minutes
- **Memory Leaks**: 0

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Events as Heap-Allocated Pointers
Zig Events are value types (structs), but C-ABI uses heap-allocated pointers with reference counting for consistency with other DOM objects.

### 2. Constants as Functions
WebIDL constants exposed as getter functions:
```c
unsigned short phase = dom_event_constant_at_target();
```

**Reason**: C doesn't have portable constant exports without headers.

### 3. CustomEvent.detail as void*
WebIDL `any` type mapped to `void*` in C-ABI:
```c
void* detail = dom_customevent_get_detail(event);
MyData* data = (MyData*)detail; // Caller casts to correct type
```

### 4. Event Constructors Deferred
Event/CustomEvent constructors NOT exposed in C-ABI v1:
- Events typically created by JavaScript engines
- Low priority for initial C-ABI
- Tracked for future work

### 5. Event Listeners Deferred
`addEventListener` / `removeEventListener` NOT implemented:
- Require callback infrastructure
- C function pointer handling needed
- Tracked for Phase 5

---

## What's Next

### Completed Phases (4)
1. ✅ Phase 1: Event System
2. ✅ Phase 2: Collections (NodeList, HTMLCollection)
3. ✅ Phase 3: Text Nodes (CharacterData, Text, Comment, etc.)
4. ✅ Phase 4: Attributes (Attr, NamedNodeMap, DOMImplementation)

### Remaining Phases (3+)
5. ⏳ Event Listeners (addEventListener, removeEventListener)
6. ⏳ Ranges (Range, StaticRange)
7. ⏳ Traversal (NodeIterator, TreeWalker)
8. ⏳ Shadow DOM (ShadowRoot, slots)
9. ⏳ Custom Elements (CustomElementRegistry)

### Immediate Next Steps (Recommend Phase 5)
Phase 5 would complete the Event system by adding:
- Callback infrastructure for C function pointers
- `addEventListener` / `removeEventListener`
- Event listener options (capture, once, passive)
- Full integration tests with event dispatch + handling

Estimated time: 2-3 hours

zig build lib-js-bindings

# Compile test
cd js-bindings
gcc -o test_events test_events.c ../zig-out/lib/libdom.a -lpthread

# Run test
./test_events

# Verify exports
nm ../zig-out/lib/libdom.a | grep " T _dom_event"
```
